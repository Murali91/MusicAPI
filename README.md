# MusicAPI
REST API developed using Node.js (restify, mongoose) to access the Music database hosted in MongoDB remotely

I have also included basic authorization, IP Whitelisting and API throttling in this API. Usage instructions of the API has been added as comments at the start of each module.

I have not included my database connector in this attachment since I used Remote DB of very less disk space. You can easily create one using the following link and use the connector in this program.

Please let me know if there is any improvement or optimization that can be made to the code. However, this is just the initial draft of the code and I'll keep updating it when I get time.

Thank you for your time !!!
